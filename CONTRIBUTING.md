Why I started this project
When I was studying, I had a strong desire to contribute to open source. Unfortunately, I faced a lot of obstacles in that path. Eventually I found what I was doing wrong. I was trying to do everything at once. I learned that a gradual approach is best to get started.

That’s when I stared First contributions. It started off as a hands-on tutorial to provide an understanding of contribution workflow (pull request style) in GitHub. I wanted to give everybody the joy of getting their first pull request.

I started collecting feedback from users on how to take it forward. Most people wanted suggestions on which projects to start contributing. We started building a web app for suggesting projects. We also started a slack group for anybody to ask questions or get help.

What we learned from first contributions
One thing I learned from this project is that there is a big gap between projects that are looking for new contributors and people who are trying to start contributing to open source projects. It’d be awesome to bridge that gap.

There is still a lot of friction for beginners to start contributing. Even with a lot of effort from maintainer’s side, it’s really hard to make your project beginner friendly. Take a look at this discussion in nodejs admins repo
